# Lab Assignment: CS151 Lab3: Ski Jump

# Problem Statement:Winter is coming! One winter sport is the ski jump, where the score is determined by the distance /n
# traveled after skiing down a ramp and into the air.
# What type of speed does a ski jumper need to achieve on the ramp to make a good distance on their jump?
# Let’s make a program to calculate the distance traveled based on speed and determine how many points they’d /n
# receive if they went that distance.
# purpose : Given the type of ski jump and the jumper’s speed at the end of the ramp, predict how far they will jump \n
# and calculate the number of points they will earn

# Constants
# set all constant variables to 0

# Data In:
# Prompt the user to give the hill type
# Prompt the user to give the type of hill and the jumper’s speed at the end of the ramp


# Decisions:
# create boolean for if ramp is normal, large, or otherwise
# set the variables for the constants for height, points_per_meter, par for the respective ramp types
# If ramp is not large or normal print error and use last else function or exit function


# Processing:
# do calculations to find the jumpers time_in_air (sqrt((2*height)/9.8))
# calculate the distance (speed * time in the air)
# calculate the amount of points gained (60 + (distance – par)*points_per_meter)
# Data Out:
# if distance is above 60 the print Great job for doing better than par!
# if distance is below 10 the print What happened?
# otherwise print Sorry you didn't go that far
